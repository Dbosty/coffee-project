            With these visualizations we would like to shed light on quality, quantity, and equity factors 
            across different regions for the benefit of coffee producers, enthusiasts, investors, and policymakers.
            Through analysis and visualizations of the dimensions of coffee production and consumption, 
            including import-export dynamics, coffee prices, and overall coffee aspects and quality. 
            For example, we were particularly interested in further exploring the differences between countries 
            that primarily export coffee versus those that import it. It became apparent that we all think itâ€™s important to have 
            a better understanding of where commodities like coffee come from and how it actually gets to our mug every morning.
